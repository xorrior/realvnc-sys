 * @file
 * @brief Manage the RSA key used to securely identify this endpoint
 *
 * Each endpoint is identified securely with an RSA key, used for providing end-
 * to-end verification of the peer's identity during connections.  The RSA key
 * is generated automatically when needed by incoming or outgoing connections.
 *
 * The vnc_RsaKey_getDetails() function is used to make an asynchronous request
 * for the fingerprint of the local key, and the results are returned via a
 * vnc_RsaKey_Callback::detailsReady callback. Note you can call this function
 * at app start-up to force key generation, which might be useful on slower
 * platforms such as the Raspberry Pi to help prevent connection failures.
