   * The Cloud listener internally handles errors due to transient networking

   * re-established, the Cloud listener stops, leaving the application to choose
   * whether to retry or to present an error message to the user.  In a

   * retry wherever possible; in a short-lived "helpdesk" application it may be
   * desirable not to retry at all when there are errors but simply present a
   * message to the user.
   *
   * Some errors are unrecoverable, such as invalid Cloud credentials, and in

   * listener using the same credentials.  In this case, @p retryTimeSecs is

   * For recoverable errors (such as a lack of network connectivity), is is
   * possible to retry listening.  This is done by destroying the Cloud
   * listener, then creating a new one after a delay.  The delay should not be
   * too short, or excessive bandwidth and needless load on the VNC Cloud will
   * be generated.  The @p retryTimeSecs parameter indicates a safe delay to
   * use, starting at five seconds and gradually increasing to a maximum
   * with each failure.  Do not retry more rapidly than indicated by
   * @p retryTimeSecs, or service may be impaired for other users of VNC Cloud
   * at times of peak load.
