/**
 * @file
 * @brief Implement a custom Windows HANDLE-based event loop.
 *
 * The following functions are used for integrating the VNC SDK into an
 * existing Windows HANDLE-based event loop.  This could either be an
 * application's event loop implemented directly using
 * @c MsgWaitForMultipleObjects, or a third party event loop where the SDK's
 * event HANDLEs can be registered (for example using Qt's QWinEventNotifier).
 *
 * The functions in this file are all only available on Windows, and an
 * assertion is used to verify that vnc_init() was used to create a Windows
 * event loop.
 *
 * See the basicViewerWin sample for an example of how to integrate this into an
 * existing Windows event loop using @c WaitForMultipleObjects.
 *
 * To integrate into a third-party event loop (for use with a framework such as
 * Qt), implement the vnc_EventLoopWin_Callback::eventUpdated and
 * vnc_EventLoopWin_Callback::timerUpdated callbacks to create, update or
 * destroy the appropriate notifiers for the framework.  On receiving
 * notifications, call vnc_EventLoopWin_handleEvent().

   * HANDLE owned by the SDK is signalled.  This callback does not get called
   * for events that were created by the SDK prior to the callback being set;
   * the implementation should use vnc_EventLoopWin_getEvents() to query those
   * when vnc_EventLoopWin_setCallback() is called.
   *
