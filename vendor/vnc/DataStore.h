/**
 * @file
 * @brief Creates a persistent data store.
 *
 * For both a Viewer and a Server, you must create a data store in which the SDK
 * can store an automatically-generated RSA public/private key pair and
 * retrieve it on demand.  The RSA key is required for encryption and identity
 * verification, and connections cannot be established without it.  Note the SDK
 * also stores other data, for example VNC Cloud discovery information.
 *
 * You can either call an appropriate method to let the SDK create and manage
 * a suitable data store for you, or else call vnc_DataStore_createCustomStore()
 * to create your own store in which you put and get data when notified by the
 * SDK. Note that key generation itself occurs at the time of the  first
 * connection unless you force it by calling vnc_RsaKey_getDetails() after you
 * create your data store (this might help prevent connection failures on slower
 * platforms such as the Raspberry Pi).
 *
 * Only one data store can exist in your Viewer or Server at a time.  If you
 * create a new data store, an existing data store is automatically replaced.
 * Any SDK functions that read or write to the data store will produce
 * a @c DataStoreError while no data store exists.
 *
 * Note that functions declared in this header may be called before calling
 * vnc_init().
